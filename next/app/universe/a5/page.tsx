  abstract: 'Mimetic unicellular organisms have profound transdisciplinary applications, extending beyond the confines of traditional biology. This article examines the transformative potential of these organisms within art, architecture, and biomedicine. We discuss their utility in developing bio-art installations that challenge our aesthetic experiences, their influence on biomimetic architectural designs that adapt responsively to environmental stimuli, and their promise in pioneering biotechnological advancements, such as bio-interactive materials and artificial organs. Our exploration encompasses both theoretical and practical applications, showcasing projects that harness the adaptive traits of these organisms. This multidisciplinary dialogue not only underscores the versatility of mimetic unicellular organisms but also catalyzes innovation across seemingly disparate fields, suggesting a unified approach to future research and application.',
