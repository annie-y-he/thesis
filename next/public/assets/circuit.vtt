00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.000
So you guys are saying that the 
circuit just caught on fire by itself?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.420
Okay, seems like the memory chip is still intact.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.860
Let's try this:

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.500
each of you describe the things 
you've written to the chip.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.780
I'll compare them to the Chip's memory.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.020
If it seems reasonable, I'll 
give you partial credit.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:35.640
On Saturday I bought a bottle of orange 
juice from CVS before coming to school.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.920
I placed it on my desk, took out my computer,

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.540
and started reviewing the Logisim 
simulation that Noam sent me.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.520
We went to the eighth floor to 
print our datasheets and stuff,

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.600
but they were out of paper in the colored printer,

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.600
so we couldn't print it there.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.420
So here's the thing: I designed 
a box so the breadboard could fit  

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.760
into the box and our presentation looks very nice.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.220
On Sunday I was figuring out 
this neuroimaging headset thing

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.360
that is required for us to have 
interfaced with our circuit,

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.140
getting familiar with its inputs and outputs,

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.980
so that we can gain access 
to the memory we wanted.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:43.020
So we went upstairs trying to 
print whatever document we have,

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.040
but apparently all of the 
printers are out of paper

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.800
so we had to go to this plotter room 
where there's a single large printer.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.740
I used the stripper to make a lot of baby wires

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.320
because all of the chips need to 
be connected to power and ground,

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.020
so it makes it more efficient for wiring later on.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.740
I got LEDs, put it on a perfboard and then I 
soldered it together to make an LED Matrix.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.720
Sunday was it was a pretty chill day for me

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.240
I just, you know, unrolled my box

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.600
and then I sent it to the AACE 
Lab so they can laser cut.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.520
We needed a really good wire 
stripper to speed up the process.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.840
But when I went and check for it 
in the drawer, it wasn't there.  

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.940
I was in so much stress, I literally 
shot off from the building,

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.240
but remembered to close the drawer of course,

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.900
and flew to this hardware store down two avenues.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.540
I needed a cardboard box 
for the circuit components

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.960
so I went down to the basement 
of the Foundation Building

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.660
because I remembered that they 
had boxes there in the pipe room.

00:03:43.414 --> 00:03:47.400
I had to get chips for our circuit,

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.460
and then I had to download the 
datasheets from TI (Texas Instruments).

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.800
Fun fact, they make all the chips in the world.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.660
It's crazy, I know.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.300
And then after I downloaded the datasheets we were all ready to go.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.340
Okay I've got everything written down,

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.040
I will provide you with the 
feedbacks later this week.
